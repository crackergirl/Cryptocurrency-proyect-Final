Keywords: TDD, Laravel, Laravel cache, CoinLore API

Tasks that we have done:

- We have created an interface  for the cache implementation. This interface is located
  in Application/CacheSource folder. Moreover , the class that used this interface is located 
  in Infrastructure/Cache. Also we have considered that a test could be great in order to prove 
  a correct behaviour of the class. The test is in tests/app/infrastructure/Cache.

- We have also created an interface to call the CoinLore API. The interface is located in 
  Application/Datasource. The class that use this interface is in the following path: 
  app/Infrastructure (CryptoDataManager.php). A little comment about this feauture is that we have created a new 
  class called APIclient in order to test the class that is mentioned above (tests/app/APIClient)
  
A little comment about service classes (located in Application/API):
- Only GetCoinService used the class APIClient.
- The rest of the services used the cache interface. 

- In order to validate certain parameters that are used in the Controller classes, we have created
  a separate Validator class. This class is located in Application/Validator. The test from this class
  in the path tests/app/Infrastructure/Validator.
  
Some comments about controller classes:
- Service classes called Cache or CoinLore implementation.
- There are two classes (sell and buy), that used two different services. In this case, GetCoin service
  and another one based on the tasks that the controller should do.

-Another key detail is that each domain class have its own method that is capable to transform an 
 entire object into an array representation.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
